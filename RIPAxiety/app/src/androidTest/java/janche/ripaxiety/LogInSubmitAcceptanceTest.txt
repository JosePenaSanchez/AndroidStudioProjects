  User should see the assessment part of the app. The backgound should be blue,
  with a dark blue strip at the top that says:
  "Subject:
  18. Expressing a disagreement or disapproval to people you don't know very well"
  
  Beneath that should be four dark blue squares, indicating where answers will be
  selected once we implement them.
